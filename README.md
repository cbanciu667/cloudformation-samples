### Cloud Formation example projects

These cloud formation templates can be used in various combinations.
The stacks have been tested in in my test environments but it is possible that
they need some corrections before successful lunch.

- the vpc stack is also launching one vpn/nat instance for private subnets
- base VPC configuration includes 3 public and 3 private subnets
- the templates requires some Chef knowledge and they are tested only with Ubuntu 18 LTS
