### Cloud Formation code snippets for various resources

These TEST cloud formation templates can be used in various combinations.
The stacks have been tested in in my test environments but it is possible that
they need some corrections before successful lunch.

- the vpc stack is also launching one vpn/nat instance for private subnets
- base VPC configuration includes 3 public and 3 private subnets
- some of the templates requires some Chef knowledge
- ec2 instances are using Ubuntu 18 LTS
